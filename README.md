# Google URL Shortener

An Alfred Extension that uses Google's URL Shortener API to quickly shorten long URLs.

Uses a public API key created on my Google developers console. There is no way for me to see any of your URLs, though you should remember that all short urls are public. You are welcome to add your own key, it is set as a Workflow variable [see Alfred docs for more](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/variables/)

Built upon the work of
